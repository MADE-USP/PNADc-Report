# PNADc Report

This repository contains the files and data used to generate MADE's quarterly report ("Relatório Trimestral PNAD"). The microdata sets used to build the report were built using the Pesquina Nacional por Amostra de Domícilios contínua (PNADc), the main national household survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). 

The structure of the repository is as follows:

| ***Folder***| ***Description*** |
|-----|-----|
| `Database setup` | Files and R code necessary to build the microdata input files |
| `Input` | Microdata input files (.txt) used to run the model|
| `Long version` | Containing R Markdown file used to build the complete version of the report|
| `Short version` | Containing R Markdown file used to build the abridged version of the report |
